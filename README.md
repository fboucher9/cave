# CAVE
Cavern of C code for command-line tools

## Introduction

The cave project is a trip back to prehistoric times where cavemen programmed
in C.

The caveman or programmer requires only a terminal to edit, build and run
programs.  The graphical user interface has not been invented yet.  The editor
is vim, the build system in gnu make and git is version control system.  The
caveman consults man pages for help.

The caveman does not trust anything that is outside of his cave.  Everything
must be built by his own hands.  The number of dependencies must be minimal
such as libc and pthread.

Join the cave project, become a caveman programmer and enjoy creating programs
that are made by your bare hands.
